            As you learned earlier, to center an element (like a table) horizontally, you can position the element in a flexbox and apply justify-content: center to the flexbox. In this code, you can see how we use that CSS property-value pair as part of a .center
            selector rule. We apply that rule to a div container that surrounds the table. In the table rule, the border-collapse: collapse property-value pair Then Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current(AC)induction motor and transformer

            We apply that rule to a div container that surrounds the table. In the table rule, the border-collapse: collapse property-value pair Then Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current(AC)induction motor and transformer. With constant AC frequency, an
            induction motor's speed cannot vary, but it is cheaper and more durable than a DC motor. Since a transformer has no moving parts and just two windings, it is cheaper and more durable than a DC genset.

            So at the dawn of the 20th century, AC won "the war of the currents." But not forever. In the middle of the 20th Century, computers began consuming progressively more DC power. Then came the insulated-gate bipolar transistor(IGBT)and the voltage-source
            converter(VSC). A VSC can make variable-frequency AC which runs induction motors at variable speed, and it easily transforms DC. DC power, computer control, and the internet are helping the power grid accept variable renewable resources like
            wind and solar

            are improving electrical distribution systems on campuses, in neighborhoods, and in buildings. With local energy generation and storage, distribution systems are evolving into robust "microgrids."
